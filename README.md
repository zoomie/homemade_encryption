# homemade_encryption
I'm interested in making my own secure connection in golang. In the process of doing this I would like to gain a better understanding of current cryptography and network security. 

The reason for this repo is that I want to understand and try use the Wireguard implementation descripbe in this whitepaper https://www.wireguard.com/papers/wireguard.pdf

My current gameplan is to go through the secutiry chapter in this book (http://iips.icci.edu.iq/images/exam/Computer-Networks---A-Tanenbaum---5th-edition.pdf) and then work backwards.

I'm sure my plan will change as I learn more but that seems good for now.
